### Sources

Six European countries and the USA released data in response to requests while
16 others have either refused or failed to respond to questions about their
complicity in the CIAâ€™s illegal detention operations. The European air traffic
management body Eurocontrol also refused on the grounds that it has no
transparency obligations to the public.
